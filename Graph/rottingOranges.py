    LeetCode 994: Rotting Oranges

    Given a grid where:
      - 0 = empty cell
      - 1 = fresh orange
      - 2 = rotten orange

    Every minute, any fresh orange adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
    Return the minimum number of minutes until no fresh orange remains.
    If impossible, return -1.
